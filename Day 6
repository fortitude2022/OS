=================================== Process Validity ======================================

Def: making sure a process says what it is
Importance: also important for offense, good to know if programs on foreing device are legitimate and doing what they say they are doing;
	enumeration of programs is important to figure out if specific releases have vulnerabilities;
	enumeration of files its reaching out to can be used as pivot points for a compromised program;


--------------Processes---------------
Process: user activated/ineracted 
killable w/o admin rights
in order to view, you need the API 
	you can hide things from the API, but not kernel
		get-wmiobject win32_process is a workaround for processes hidden form API
		
-Get-CimInstance win32_process | where {$_.Name -like "powershell_ise.exe" } | select *

-3 processes youll see under 1000 FOR USERS
	winlogon, csrss, lsass

Orphan and Zombie Processes:
	-child proc w/ dead parent proc
	-zombie proc is waiting for stopOrd form parent proc/ but parent proc is stopped
	
Process IDs below 4, fucky

get-ciminstance win32_process | ...
... select-object -property @{Expression = "ParentProcessID"; Ascending = $true }, @{Expression = $ProcessID; Ascending = $true} ...
... | Format-table -property Name, ProcessID, ParentProcessID, path, commandline -autosize | outfile -width 4096 $home\desktop\processes.txt





Service: Background, automatic, non-interactive
	-can also be launched by meeting of certain criteria
	-w/o admin rights can only be paused/restarted
	-

Dynamic Linked Library: callable commands used by processes/services, easy to compromise
	run32.dll common dll used by many applications
