======================================== Linux Boot Proc =================================================

	SVR4 BMGKIR (System 5 Release 4)
	Systemd
	
----------------SVR4-----------------

BIOS (Basic Input Output System)
	execs MBR
MBR ( Master Boot Record )
	1st 512B contain MBR
	Bootstrap code
		446B
	partition table
		64B
		x4 partitions
			partit entries have: part flag, start chs, part byte, end chs, start lba, size
	boot signature
		2B aka magic number
		0x55AA ALWAYS
	MBR is LOCATED in -----/dev/sda-----
	
GRUB 
	Grand Unified Bootloader
	execs Kernel
	menu.lst/grub.conf(v1) grub.cfg(v2)

Kernel
	executes /sbin/init
Init
	
Runlevel
	exec from /etc/rc.d/rc*.d/

----------------Systemd------------------

BIOS/UEFI Firmware
	BIOS -> POST
	UEFI conf Hardware
	Control passed to next step
MBR/UEFI Execs
	
GRUB

Kernel

Systemd

Targets



============================BIOS MBR=====================
COMMANDS:

xxd = hexdump 
df = shows where things are mounted
dd = conver/copy a file, byte by byte copy; block size
-ps -p
-sudo xxd -l 512 -g 1 /dev/vda

make copy of boot record

-dd if=/dev/vda of=mbrcopy bs=512 count=1
	if = infile; of = outfile; bs = Blocksize; 

at start of MBR:
0xeb63 = jump 63B, hits a 9090 NOOP and then reads what its supposed to

======================= GRUB ============================
-"spools up the kernel"
only worry about grub.cfg since what we are working with is grub v2
config file /boot/grub/menu.lst

w/in grub conf you can see what kernel version selectable

(check thru this with g o' s)
BIOS and UEFI slight different, esp file names

BIOS GRUB = boot.ing
GRUB v2 (Kali start screen)
	allows to choose between different distros 

UEFI GPT
	grub.efi 
	stage 2 boot/grub/grub.cfg 
	x86_64.exe/normal.mod


=================== Kernel =====================
process:
	uncomps into RAM
	est memory mgmnt, detect cpu type, page tables
	mounts root '/' filesyst
	K = Process 0 [kthreadd]
	execs /sbin/init OR systemd daemon PID 1
	ls -l /sbin/init to determine WHICH INIT system you are on
		system d will have an /sbin/init file POINTING to /lib/systemd/systemd 
/sbin/init PID 1
will run w/ different names depending on system 5 of systemd
init vs systemd
(see slide for more on links to where init files lead)

----------------System5r4--------------

Run Levels 0-6
6 REBOOT
5 multi-user GUI
4 unused-udefine
3 default-full multi-user text mode
2 unused- userdefined
1 single user-text mode
0 HALT

Process Manager
Service Manager (run scripts)
Serial System Initialization
Config File: /etc/inittab
	every line not commented out is a config option
Script location: /etc/init.d
	different processes i.e. ssh, can be managed here
Run-level scripts location: /etc/rc*.d
	ANYTHING w/in these files thats linked to something OTHER than init.d is a REDFLAG
	
---------------- Systemd ----------------- One Stop Shop -----------------

Process Mngr
Service Mngr (.ini -like format )
Login, boot, network, NDS, timesync, logging, etc manager
Parallel, dependa based system initzn
Config locales:
	/etc/systemd/system:user-made .unit files
	/lib/systemd/system:system-made + pkg installed files
	
ls -lisa /lib/systemd/system/default.target points to graphical.target

ls -lisa /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target.wants




.target .service .mount (as .ini files in WIN)



requires = what needs to happen
want = what it will try to run
conflicts = if tgt is running, this wont run
after = what it will try to reach after

===================== systemctl ==============
on all systemd systems
systemctl list-dependencies graphical.target
telemetry of different services

systemctl show -p Wants graphical.target
does same but on one line

systemctl cat graphical.target
prints the lib/systemd...graphical.target file (shorthand for above method)

systemctl list-unit-files


SysV Run levels and Systemd Targets
Halt 				0 	poweroff.target
Single User txt 	1	rescue.target 	
Multi U txt, nonet	2	multi-user.target
full,MU,Net,txt		3	""
unused				4	""
X11 (GUI)			5	graphical.target
Reboot				6	reboot.target

SysV Directories	SystemD Targets
/etc/init.d/rc		/etc/systemd/system

-----login script------
/etc/profile
	refers to /etc/bash.bashrc

/etc/profile for login shells

non-login bashrc, bash_profile

/etc/profile is great for persistence due to it running ON ALL USERS


==================== SystemD Targets Continued =====================

Instead of Run levels in SysV, systemd usese .target(s)

-------(copy of above table in systemctl) -----------------
SysV Run levels and Systemd Targets
Halt 				0 	poweroff.target

Multi U txt, nonet	2	multi-user.target

unused				4	""

---------------------------------------------------------
SysV Directories	SystemD Targets

---------------------------------------------------------






============== NOTES ==============

-etc/inittab not on systemd

question: go into a bkup up an MBR, pull out the 16 bytes in rel to the FIRST partition, and md5sum it
	dd ibs=1 if=mbroken of=mbrokenmd5 skip=446 count=16
	ibs can be replaced w/ bs (same value of 1)
		bs option reads each byte as 1 at a time
		if and of are in/out file options
		skip does as say, will skip to nth byte
		count does as says

		alternatively: to copy only the first x amt of bytes:
	dd if=infile of=outfile bs=512 count=1
		(use bs over ibs until a real need for ibs arises)
Tip: Both SysV and SystemD:
	- query which w/ ls -l /sbin/init
	
Tip: SysV systems:
	-Dfault Run level found at top of /etc/inittab file
	- you can find what run level a daemon (resp for certain svcs) will run in by default by checking the...
	... /etc/init.d directory: find responsible daemon, cat and find #BEGIN INIT INFO -> Default Start <values>
	
Tips: SystemD systems:
	-Find default TARGET (pseudo-equivalent to SysV Run-level)
		systemctl cat default.target
			top of catted content should have PATH to DEFAULT.target
	-Cont from above: FIND CONFIG file for a certain target
		systemctl cat example.target
			top should be a /lib/systemd/system/example.target config file
	-Requires field in a .target config file is a service that must be triggered in order for that target to be achieved
	-Wants field is what that .target wants to start when that .target is successfully toggled
