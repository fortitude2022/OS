================================== Active Directory Enumeration ============================

Active Directory is the name of the SOFTWARE form Microsoft that manages a Domain Controller

Domain Controller:
	1 master authenticator
	Domain conts based on names for hosts
		requires a DNS, if none detected, DC will become DNS
	Primary DC:
		head DC, the big man, the don, the capo
		essentially the Iron throne
			create it, lock it away
			24 ports that are used, deactivate all others
	Secondary DC:
		DCs made and join domain
		REPLICATE Primary DC's information
		offers decoy and redundancy
					
	Read Only DCs
		reads authentication and passes it
		doesnt preform the authentication
	
	modern: forks request, saves nothing 
		cache only requires many options no adays to prevent people form using it] 

AD uses same algorithm, same salt, as Server 2003. Both are public 
	CANT change salt because it will fuck with kerberos
when 2ndDC wants to make a change, sends a push request to 1DC, so that 1DC can potnly push updated info to other 2ndDCs. 
bad to make settings changes on the primary DC itself

Domain types:
	Normal
		contains Child-domains
	Flat-Domains: Suck
		1 DC across the board
		trust variations
			2 way trust
			1 way trust
				parent to child
					child accepts creds from parent
				child to parent
					parent accepts creds from child
				aka segmented domains

Notes:

	beware, FGuide is wrong about Domain/tree semantics gobbldygook
	
get-localuser
	on srver w AD/DC, every acc is condrd local, regarless of lodal/domain
get-aduser
	gets ONLY domain users
get-addomain
	DNSRoot built directly from DistinguishedName
	
	
	
	
Remote server admin toolkit
RSAT
	software suite of admin tools for DC, good for admin stations
Otherwise:
load module active directory:
	get-module activedirectory
	
any srv not DC, listed as a Computer

STALE ACCOUNTS are key to persistence on a system, biggest threat to a system's security


For Help:
	get-command get-adad*password*


LockoutDuration             : 00:30:00
	amt time locked out
	if 0, requires admin unlock
LockoutObservationWindow    : 00:30:00
	time where tries are allowed
LockoutThreshold
	if 0, can try infinite


------------------------------- Groups ----------------------------
Security Groups:
	for permissions
	Global and Universal
		Universal: anything w/in that forest
		Global: only for that domain
	SecGroup Flaw:
		when applying perms to groups, you can have nested groups
			easy way to give people higher privs than needed
			get-adgroup -Identity "Domain Admins"
			and adgroupmember
			get-adgroupmember -id "D As" -recursive
		Explicit Denys exist to block certain actions
			 MS's official way to fix nested groups
		get-aduser -filter * | where {$_.name -like "String.name"}
			gets specific domain user
		get-aduser -filter * | where {$_.name -like "String.name"} | select *
			wont work
		get-aduser -filter * -properties * | where {$_.name -like "String.name"} | select *
			will work
Distribution Groups:
	information passing


BOLO:

krbtgt if enabled allows to create new master tickets, bad...

search-adaccount -AccountExpired | select name
get-aduser -filter * -properties * | where {$_.enables -eq $false} | select name, enabled

view group policies:

gpresult /r


============================================ Notes in somehwat order ==========================================

from CTFds:
-Domain portion of a SID is section that starts w/ 2 digit group num and ends right before 4 digit user number
-get-adgroup -filter *
	gets list of domain groups
-get-aduser -filter *
	shows users w/ Default settings
-get-aduser -filter * -properties *
-search-adaccount ...
	-accountdisabled
		shows disabled accts
	-accountexpired
		expired accts
	get-help search-adaccount for more...
