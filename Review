    run keys in HKLM, HKCU
	$profiles
		$pshome\$profile = allusersallhosts
		AUAH is the $profile that PS will prioritize
		test-path $PROFILE will return true/false
		test-path $PROFILE.allusersallhosts or others
		slack script available on slack for it: 
$Recycle.bin
	$R is address
	$I is content
path ususally: 
	C:\$Recycle.bin\<SID>\item
Other windows artifacts and where to find them...
	
	
get-item HKLM:\ s m w cv Run
	get-item and NOT get-content, gi reads the key

CMD bcdedit command
	bcdedit output:
		WBL
			path, if winload.exe, then BIOS
			path, if winload.efi, is UEFI
			for test, it will be BIOS
		
		
Ignore:
	drivers
	dlls, deep insides of executables
	names of files are fair game, internals of files are a rabbit hole
	no string analysis

Focus:
	Host Enumeration
		Who am i
			w, who, whoami, ifconfig
		where am i
			ifconfig
			timezone enum
			arp cache
		what am i
		whats going on
		whys that happening
		whats in the machine
		what can i do
			what permissions
				sudo -l
				if: (ALL : ALL) ALL, then can sudo everything
		am i connected
			netstat
			ss -ntlp
				n numeric
				l listening
				p process
				t tcp
				u udp (unneccessary?)
				if no proc name/pid, that means no permissions to see that output, use sudo to fix
		processes:
			ps -elf --forest | grep -B <lines> <PID>
				-B before lines
				-A after lines
				--context=x both sides
			htop, live image

Parent PID of 1
	may show systemd designation
	daemon - usually
	malicious to orphan itself
	
	assume you want to look at config for sshd svc:
		for systemd:
			systemctl cat ssh
				cats the ssh service config file
				good to look w/in these files
					i.e. cat /etc/ssh/sshd.config
					might find strange settings in here
	for sysV systems, usr/bin/inittab
Check log files
cron usual suspect for persistence
	cron = parent process
		system ran(?)ish
	CRON = child proc of cron
	etc/crontab
		everything under CRON would (usually, esp in course) be run by USER
		var/spool/cron/cronttab is USER, other two are SYSTEM (/etc/cron.d ; /etc/crontab)
	anacron is legit
		etc/cron.weekly and others will have stuff w/in them
	
other persistence:
	/etc/profile
	/etc/bashrc
	.bashrc in home
	.profile
	other bash related like bash_profile
