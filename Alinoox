========================= FILE PERMISSIONS ==============================
<type> User; Group; Other: Octal values for who can access a file in certain ways
Read, Write, Execute

t: Sticky Bit: Only user who creates file can delete it
s: SGID (Group) the execution of a file will occur under group owner's name
s: SUID (User) execution will occur as file owner

SUID 4; SGID 2; Sticky 1

to add:

chmod X### file.txt
	where X is the bit you want set
	
the /usr/bin/passwd command has the SUID bit set ( an S where the X would be under U section)
this allows users who are not root, the ability to change the /etc/shadow file
